	<h1>Main Window</h1>

	<p>Upon successfully launching the application, you will see a window similar to this:</p>

	<img src="mainwindow.png" alt="Main window" width="601" height="316" />

	<p>The numbered areas are as follows:</p>

	<h2>1) Menubar</h2>
	<p>Here you may access a number of menus; "File", "Tools", and "Help". The "File" menu has a single menu item, "Quit", which you can click to exit the program. The "Tools" menu has the entry "Simulate", to load the simulation module. Finally, the "Help" menu has items "Documentation" and "About"; the former opens this user guide, while selecting "About" will open a dialog window displaying information about this software.</p>

	<h2>2) Process Information Table</h2>
	<p>This table is where you can monitor system tasks. Note that there are three headings to the table; "Process ID", "Name", and "Status". For every process on your system, a row should be added to the table with entries under each of these columns, with regard to the details of that process. By default, the table will update the information of its rows every three seconds.</p>
	<p>A scrollbar will appear on the right-hand side of the window if it is not possible to display all processes in the available space. If this is so, you may drag the scrollbar to browse down further through the processes.</p>
	<p>It is possible to sort the rows displayed by column; simply click on the respective column header to show in ascending order, or click twice for descending. For example, to list the processes in alphabetical order, click once upon the "Name" header.</p>
	<p>From the table, you may open the visualisation module, which allows you to manage the selected process and displays a visual representation of its state transitions. To open this module, navigate within the table to the process you want to view, and double-click on its "Process ID", "Name", or "State" table cell.</p>

	<h2>3) Pause/Resume Button</h2>
	<p>Updating of the process information table, as previously described, can be stopped. This may be desirable to thoroughly view the table's contents. To do so, simply click the button with the pause symbol; the updating is now stopped indefinitely. Notice that the button's icon now changes from a pause symbol to a play symbol; if and when you wish to resume the updating, use the button again. Once resumed, the table and button will return to their initial states.</p>
