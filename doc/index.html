	<h1>Welcome!</h1>

	<p>This application gives you the ability to monitor and manage the processes currently residing on your 64-bit Linux-based system, with an emphasis on enabling you to visualise what is happening from the system's perspective.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this software is to allow you to learn about process state transitions, while also providing useful system management facilities, all from one easy to use interface.</p>

	<p>To install the program, we recommend using the install.sh script; simply navigate to its location via terminal, and enter "./install.sh". Follow the script's instructions, and it will install the program to /usr/bin or the local directory. Note that the former option requires root permissions.<br />
	Following installation, you can launch the program by entering "./TaskStalker" in the directory in which it was installed. If you later wish to remove the application, you can again use install.sh; execute it instead as "./install.sh -uninstall".</p>
