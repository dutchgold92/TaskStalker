Welcome! This brief manual explains how to install or remove our software, Task Stalker. Thank you for showing your interest.

# Install #
###########

To install this software, simply navigate to this directory via command line and perform:
	./install.sh
(You may need to first do "chmod +x install.sh", if you receive an error.)

From there, simply follow the instructions and all installation will be done for you. Assuming it is successful, you may then launch the program by executing:
	/usr/bin/TaskStalker
or, if you chose local installation, simply:
	./TaskStalker

Note: To install to /usr/bin, you will need to execute the install script with root permissions.

# Uninstall #

If you have finished using this program and would like to uninstall it, return to this directory via command line and similarly to installation, perform:
	./install.sh -uninstall
You can still reinstall the application at a later occasion, as done previously.

Note: If you had installed to /usr/bin, the program cannot be removed from here unless you execute the install script with remote permissions.
